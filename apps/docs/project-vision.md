# Latte AI Portfolio — Project Vision

## Overview

Latte AI Portfolio is an experimental, interactive portfolio experience presented as a cozy 3D coffee shop.

Instead of traditional pages or chat interfaces, visitors explore my background, projects, and skills by interacting with an AI barista who serves responses as coffee.

The project blends 3D environments, AI-driven interaction, and personal storytelling to create a memorable and emotionally engaging portfolio.

## Vision

To create a portfolio that feels:
- Warm instead of transactional
- Playful but technically serious
- Memorable rather than skimmable

This project is designed to show not only *what* I’ve built, but *how I think about product design, systems, and user experience*.

---

## Primary Goals

### 1. Showcase Personal Work
- Present projects, skills, and experience
- Communicate personality and values
- Replace static portfolio sections with interaction

### 2. Explore AI as an Interface
- Use AI as a guide, not a chatbot
- Constrain AI to a clear persona and domain
- Focus on storytelling over raw information delivery

### 3. Experiment with 3D UX
- Use 3D as an emotional layer, not a gimmick
- Keep interaction simple and intentional
- Prioritize clarity and performance over complexity

### 4. Demonstrate System Thinking
- Clear separation of concerns
- Thoughtful architecture
- Well-defined MVP boundaries

## Target Audience

- Recruiters and hiring managers
- Designers and engineers
- Curious visitors exploring creative portfolios

The project is optimized for *first impressions*, not power users.

---

## Core Experience Principles

- **Simplicity first**: One room, one barista, one flow
- **Consistency**: All answers appear as coffee
- **Delight without friction**: Cute, but not confusing
- **Intentional constraints**: AI only knows what it should

---

## Success Criteria (MVP)

The project is considered successful if:
- A visitor can enter the coffee shop
- Interact with the menu or ask a question
- Receive a clear AI-generated response
- See the response rendered visually as coffee

---

## Explicit Non-Goals

This project does NOT aim to:
- Be a general-purpose AI assistant
- Support user accounts or authentication
- Include voice interaction in MVP
- Provide complex 3D navigation or physics
- Replace a resume or LinkedIn profile

These may be explored later, but are intentionally excluded from the MVP.

---

## Constraints

- Performance-friendly (no heavy scenes)
- Accessible and readable text
- AI responses must be factual and grounded in real portfolio data
- Scope limited to a single interactive environment
