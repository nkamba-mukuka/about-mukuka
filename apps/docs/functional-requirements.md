# Functional Requirements & MVP Scope

## Purpose

This document defines the functional requirements for the Latte AI Portfolio MVP.
It focuses on observable behavior and user-facing functionality, independent of implementation details.

---

## MVP Scope Summary

The MVP consists of a single interactive 3D coffee shop environment where users can:
- Select predefined menu items
- Ask free-form questions
- Receive AI-generated responses
- View responses rendered visually as coffee

---

## User Roles

### Visitor (Primary User)
- Anonymous
- No authentication required
- Interacts with the environment and AI

---

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Application Entry
- The system shall load a single 3D coffee shop scene on first visit
- The user shall not be required to log in or configure settings

---

### FR-2: Menu Interaction
- The system shall display a visible menu within the 3D environment
- The menu shall include predefined categories (e.g., About, Projects, Skills)
- The user shall be able to select a menu item via click or tap

---

### FR-3: Question Input
- The system shall allow the user to submit a free-form text question
- The input mechanism may be separate from the 3D environment (overlay UI)

---

### FR-4: AI Response Generation
- The system shall send user selections or questions to an AI service
- The AI service shall generate responses constrained to portfolio-related content
- The AI shall follow a predefined persona (coffee shop barista)

---

### FR-5: Coffee-Based Output Visualization
- The system shall render a coffee cup in response to user interaction
- The AI response text shall appear visually on or above the coffee
- The text shall be readable and limited to a reasonable length

---

### FR-6: State Reset
- The system shall allow multiple interactions per session
- Each interaction shall generate a new coffee response
- Previous responses do not need to persist between sessions

---

## Out of Scope (MVP)

- User accounts or profiles
- Voice input or speech synthesis
- Persistent chat history
- Multiple rooms or environments
- Multiplayer or social features

---

## Error Handling

- If the AI service fails, the system shall display a friendly fallback message
- The fallback message shall still be rendered as a coffee response

---

## Acceptance Criteria

The MVP is complete when:
- A user can trigger at least one menu-based response
- A user can ask a custom question
- Responses are generated by AI
- Responses are visually represented as coffee
